# Q5GRP3AutomationPractice

Automation Practice is a mock E-Commerce Website that was broken down among the group members into four different parts:

- Sign In & Cart Page.
- Home Page
- Dresses Page
- Women's Page.

Manual Testing & Automation Testing both took place to test the Website.

Here is a link to our Test Plan in Jira which consists of how the Testing occured from start to end:

The Website was tackled in an efficient way to ensure that a reliable product would be sent to the Client.

Thank you!
